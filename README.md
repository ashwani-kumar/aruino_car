# aruino_car
Obstacle avoiding car based on arduino platform

It uses a utrasonic sensor for obstacle ditection. When the object is close enough it scans to left and right and then moves to the direction which has more open space or no obstacle.

I have used following components:
Motor driving shield and 
Arduino mega board.
HC-SR01 utrasonic sensor.
Tower pro servo motor.
Two DC motors.
Few wire connectors.
